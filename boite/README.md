The bo√Æte project has been made in order to test my skils during an interview.

The goal was to get the most custom code possible login page with all features normally foud in a login page.

So I wanted to create a login page uasing the yubikey techology in order to better protect the login. So I used some code fromn yubikey in order to do the JS magic with the yubikey key. I used ChatGPT as a mentor in order to do my code since it has been 25 years since I did not do any custom code, aleays using one forme of framework or CMS since.
You can find all questions and answers from ChatGPT in the boite.txt file.
