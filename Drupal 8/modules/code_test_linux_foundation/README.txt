Here you will find a module I created for a test during the application process
of the LINUX Foundation.

It is a module that creates a voting page for people to select in which city
they would prefer to go to for next DrupalCon. The list of cities is selected
from a REST API served by the LINUX Foundation at that time.

It also creates a route and menu item for the test form.

The REST API server may or may not respond anymore.  Feel free to create one for run.
