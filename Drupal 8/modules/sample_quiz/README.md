# Sample Quiz

This module is a sample of my work on a specific website. It does not work standalone because it depends on some content
types being defined.

The user will be asked to choose preferences based on quiz questions. The choices are made Taxonomy terms. The user
selection will be registered in his cookies. In pages where Listings entities are shown in a view the order will be
selected using the preferred taxonomy terms.

In order to realize that I created a React application for the quiz itself, and a Views plugin to create the custom sort
using the preferred terms.
