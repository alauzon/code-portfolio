Domain user edit is used to restrict access to edit users 
to only let users with the 'administer users' permission AND assigned to
the my_modulee domain, using the Domain module, to edit the user.

To by-pass this restriction, you can assign the new permission 'edit all users'.

Note: at the moment this module ONLY limits edit access, not delete or block access.
